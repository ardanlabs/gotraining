## Ultimate Data - Prediction
This is material for developers who have some experience with Go and statistics and want to learn how to work with data to make better decisions. We believe these classes are perfect for data analysts/scientists/engineers interested in working in Go or Go programmers interested in doing data analysis.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*
