## Keywords, Built-In Functions. Operators and Packages

### Keywords
Keywords are at the heart of most programming languages, and Go is no exception. These are reserved words that provide structure and meaning to the language. The emphasized keywords that follow have unique or uncommon characteristics and lend distinctiveness to the Go language.

<table>
<tr><td>break</td><td>case</td><td><b>chan</b></td><td><b>const</b></td><td>continue</td></tr>
<tr><td>default</td><td><b>defer</b></td><td>else</td><td>fallthrough</td><td><b>for</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>func</b></td><td><b>go</b></td><td>goto</td><td>if</td><td><b>import</b></td></tr>
<tr><td><b>interface</b></td><td><b>map</b></td><td><b>package</b></td><td><b>range</b></td><td>return</td></tr>
<tr><td><b>select</b></td><td>struct</td><td>switch</td><td><b>type</b></td><td>var</td></tr>
</table>

### Built-In Functions
Built-in functions enhance the programming language by providing functionality that in many other languages are left up to the developer to implement. Many of these functions make writing code in Go easier, more consistent and less prone to errors. The highlighted built-in functions are functions that are very important and will be used often in the class.

<table>
<tr><td><b>append</b></td><td>cap</td><td><b>close</b></td><td>complex</td><td>copy</td><td>delete</td><td>imag</td><td><b>len</b></td><td><b>make</b></td><td>new</td></tr>
<tr><td>panic</td><td>real</td><td><b>recover</b></td><td colspan="7"></td></tr>
</table>

### Standard Library
Go's standard library is rich with functionality that provide a lot of functionality without having to use 3rd party packages. Check out the link and see for yourself. [Standard Library](http://golang.org/pkg/)
