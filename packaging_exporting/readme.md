## Package and Exporting

Packages contain the basic unit of compiled code. They define a scope for the indentifiers that are declared within them. Learning how to package our code is vital because exported identifiers become part of the packages API. Stable and useable API's are incredibily important.

## Notes

* Code in go is complied into packages and then linked together.
* Identifiers are exported (or remain unexported) based on letter-case.
* We import packages to access exported identifiers.
* Any package can use a value of an unexported type.

[Unexported embedded types](example5/example5.go)

## Exercises

### Exercise 1
**Part A** Create a package named toy with a single exported struct type named Toy. Add the exported fields Name and Weight. Then add two unexported fields named onHand and sold. Declare a factory function called New to create values of type toy and accept parameters for the exported fields. Then declare methods that return and update values for the unexported fields.

**Part B** Create a program that imports the toy package. Use the New function to create a value of type toy. Then use the methods to set the counts and display the field values of that toy value.
