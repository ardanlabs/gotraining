## Go Training - Day 4
On this day we build a program that implements functionality that can be found in many Go programs being developed today. The program pulls different data feeds from the web and compares the content against a search term. The content that matches is then displayed to the terminal window. The program reads text files, makes web calls, decodes both XML and JSON into struct type values and finally does all of this using Go concurrency to make things fast.

*Note: This material has been designed to be taught in a classroom environment. The code is well commented but missing some of the contextual concepts and ideas that will be covered in class.*
